## Data Analytics Module 1 Code-Along Assignments

Welcome to the Data Analytics Module 1 Code-Along Assignments repository. This collection of Jupyter notebooks is designed to reinforce the foundational concepts covered in Module 1. These assignments are hands-on practice exercises that will help you solidify your understanding of key programming concepts in Python.

### Contents
This repository includes three Python notebooks, each focusing on different fundamental topics:

#### Assignment 1: Basics
- Assigning Variables
- Data Types

#### Assignment 2: Control Flow and Collections
- Conditionals (if-else statements)
- Lists
- For Loops
- List Slicing

#### Assignment 3: Even or Odd Assignment
- This final assignment combines all the above concepts in a practical exercise where you will write a program to determine if numbers are even or odd.
